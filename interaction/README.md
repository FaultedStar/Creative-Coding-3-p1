Interaction.
I feel like this project would have been cool to work with music, this may just be because my flowers now look like they are booping to a funcky beat.
For my interation I chose to have them sway on the screen, and then when the mouse is clicked, for them to bounce up and down. 
This is done to the rythem of a sign wave, the code for which can be found online under processings reference. You can also see in my previous commit that I tried out having the pettals detatch from that head.
This looked very groovy, but also a bit weird. 
From here I think I will tweek the movement because it makes me sea sick.
