And here is the whole alphebet. If you asked me to do this project again I would not pick the same topic again. This took an absolute age, but every letter is there in american finger spelling. Its not pretty. 
The fingers are not drawn in the correct order and there for some of the shapes are accually wrong. That said most can be understood by the user and repeated. The animation also goes crazy sometimes, but I like it. 
The animation makes it more humorus, like a robot trying to understand a human language and failing. 
I admit there could be a lot of approvements, but I like it still and it was a good exercise.
