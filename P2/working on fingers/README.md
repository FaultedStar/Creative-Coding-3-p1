This is maybe the most ugly code I've ever written. That said, the fingers now have joints and each have sliders. 
This means that I can get some hand shapes that accually looks like hands. There are still a few things I need to touch up.
The fingers can't straighten properly So I need to edit the sliders. The order in which the fingers are wrong so I need to write a function for that. 
Finger nails also should be drawn in order to know the orientation of the fingers.
