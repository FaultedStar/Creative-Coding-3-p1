This is the very very base of my idea. I hate fonts. I want to be able to make a hand out of simple shapes in order to show american finger spelling as the user types. 
I will have to refine the controls of this editor because at the moment it is frustating to make anything lifelike out of it, and the current symbols shown are very loose repesentations of the shapes needed.
