This is my exibition. I think the interaction is far more meaningful and useful to the user which is why I have spent most of my time on it. Just looking at the hand shapes means nothing to the user without the interaction.
That said I did try to add a "change to random letter" function, but it did not work. Instead after 5 seconds the hand resets to A. 
All in all I am pretty happy with this letter set. I showed it to a member of the Wellington sign comunity and she really loved it. 
People have asked why I picked the colours that I have for the fingers. This is because when I was learning piano each finger was coloured in this way in order for it to be easier for the teacher to instruct.
Because this is ment to be a somewhat instructional tool, I kept with the bright colours as indicators. 
I am still annoyed I haven't had time in order to draw the fingers in order, meaning some of the signs are "wrong" but that said, I think it looks cool esp when it is moving.
