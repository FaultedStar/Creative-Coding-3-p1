FINAL: 
This is my final solution to the breif. I started off knowing I wanted to make something cute and approchable with simple shapes. This evolved into my little flower. 
My flowers look like they are of the same species but each is unique. The randomness of there features are constrained so they never distort, but at the extreams the flower will look a bit funny, which is there intention.
Moving on from my interaction attempts I have desided to go with a more relaxed feel for this sketch, the flowers do not dance witht the click of a mouse but simply say slowly. This slow swaying was a little tricky to get right as I am prone to motion sickness and at higher speeds the rocking made me feel sick.
Should I move on with this project I would add stems and leafs to the flowers, and then give the sets of flowers themes such as spring, summer, winter and autumn.
I am happy with how the flowers turned out and I think I achieved my goals.
