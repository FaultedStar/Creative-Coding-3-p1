Distribution:
From here I have added the focusedRandom.js file which git didn't like. After much googling I figured out what I was doing wronge. 
I have now fixed the eyes being too close and touching problem. This is through making sure the eyes don't get too close or too big as well as making sure the if statement in the draw eyes function was working properly.
I have also made it less likely that the mouth will be open than closed. Just to give further variation.
I made it so the eyes where more likely to be big and cute, because thats when they look the best. 
The pettals do still overlap but I like this because it looks more "natural", that said the overlap is never very bad.
