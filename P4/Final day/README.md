This is my solution to the dimentional data. 
 glyph4 = Male
	glyph4 is based on the male geniatalia, a common doodle made now into a glyph that could have data read off it. 
I didnt want to make it too graphic or realistic, but it was relitively simple to make it recognisable. The data effects the balls size, colour, length and width.

glyph8 = female
	glyph8 is based on the vulva. Inspired by works of art such as the great wall of vagina http://www.greatwallofvagina.co.uk/home (NSFW).
This shows the asymmetry of the vulva and its many forms, as it is not as well graffitied as the penis. The data effects the colour, width, length, vagina size, labia size and labia shape.
This was a much more complecated shape to draw as it is not as well recognised as the penis, but still I think it was pretty successful.
